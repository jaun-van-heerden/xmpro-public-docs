# XMPro Public Docs
This repository is used for 2 way sync between the GitBook "Copy of XMPro Platform" space (aka copy of our Public Docs) and the /docs folder.

## Updating Docs in GitHub for sync to GitBook
* All content needs to be in the /docs folder to be synced.
* All page content needs to be created as Markdown files.
* Here is a full guide on structuring content.

## Other content not to be synced
* Scripts used to extract content from external sources should be added to the /scripts folder
