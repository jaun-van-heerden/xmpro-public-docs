# Subscriptions

Before being able to use any XMPro Product that is supported by the Subscription Manager, your Company will have to have a Subscription for that Product and you will have to be granted access. This process differs slightly, depending on the role that you have within your Company in the Subscription Manager.

Subscriptions to products are mainly managed by XMPro administrative users as they can approve or revoke a subscription to a product for a company. Administrative users within a company are given the responsibility to manage the products they have subscription access for in terms of which employees in their Company have access to which Subscription.&#x20;
