# Manage a Company

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that this section is intended for Global Administrative users. No other type of user is allowed to manage data about companies and their Subscriptions.
{% endhint %}

## Approve/Activate Access

Global Administrators may need to grant or modify access for new or existing companies from time to time, for example, when a new company signs up to use Subscription Manager. In this section, we will look at how to approve access for newly registered companies and companies requesting access to certain products.

### Approving Access for New Companies

When a user signs up via the Register page and marks his company as being a new company, the new company will be created, but will not have access to Subscription Manager automatically. Subscription access needs to be approved by a Global Administrator, after which the new user will receive an email and be able to log in to the system as an administrator of his/her company.

To approve such a request, please follow the steps below.

1. Open the Company page from the menu.
2. Click on the Company.
3. Click on _Subscription Requests._
4. Click on the Request.
5. Click _Save._

## **Active vs Inactive Companies**

Companies in Subscription Manager can be listed as being either active or inactive. A Company can be deactivated by a Global Administrator if, for example, the Company decided not to use XMPro anymore. If a Company is deactivated, users in that Company will lose their ability to access the system.

Inactive Companies can be found by pressing the _View Inactive_ command in the Companies list.
