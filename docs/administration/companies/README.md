# Companies

The XMPro platform is a multi-tenant environment. Each tenant is defined as a Company.  A Company is an organization that is using XMPro Products. The XMPro platform ensures that all data and user information associated with tenants is always segregated. Each Company has its own Company Administrator user(s) to manage the Company's Users, Business Roles, Rights, and Subscriptions, but they cannot see or manage any other Company. The Global Administrator can see and manage all Companies.
