## **Adding a Subscription for the new Company**

After the Company is successfully created, you will have to add a Subscription to XMPro Tools for it. To add a Subscription, please follow the steps below.

1. Click on the _Subscriptions_ gauge on the detailed page of the Company.
2. Click on _Add_.
3. Choose the Data Stream Designer Product. The exact name will depend on your installation, in this example, it is "DataStreams".
4. Request a License.

Clicking _Request a new License_ will send a request to the [XMPro support team](http://xmpro.com/support/) for a license for Data Stream Designer for this Company.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Clicking _Request a new license_ will only send a license request to XMPro if you have enabled email notifications at the time of installing Subscription Manager
