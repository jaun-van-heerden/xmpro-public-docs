## Request a new License

If a company needs to be given access to a product, such as Data Stream Designer, the Company Administrator for that company needs to submit a license request and it needs to be approved by a Global Administrator.

## Expiring License

When a Company's Subscription has less than 30 days remaining before it expires, a banner will appear at the top of the page of the Product. It will prompt you to [contact support](http://xmpro.com/support/) to renew the license and ensure you do not lose access to the Product.&#x20;
