# Install Stream Host

## Download the Connection Profile

Each Data Stream created in Data Stream Designer must belong to a [Collection](../../../concepts/collection.md). You can download the information in a Collection as a file, known as a Connection Profile. This profile includes the _device name, collection ID, server URL, secret,_ and _key_.

To simplify installing a Stream Host (also called a device), download the Connection Profile to avoid manually copying Collection details from Data Stream Designer to the installer.

To obtain a Connection Profile, follow the steps below.

1. [Log into Data Stream Designer](../../../administration/users/register-an-account.md) and open the _Collections_ page from the left-hand menu.
2. Select the Collection you wish to use. If there isnâ€™t a Collection available, you can [create one](../../../how-to-guides/data-streams/manage-collections.md) by clicking on the _New_ button, choosing a name for the collection and pressing _Ok_.
3. Click on _Connection Profile_.
4. Choose a name for the device.
5. Enter the File Key.
6. Click _Ok_. The Connection Profile will automatically begin to download.
