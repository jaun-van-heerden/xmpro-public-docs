![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1144).png>)

### Web Application

**DNS Name**

13. Verify if your DNS name is correct, if not, edit the value to contain the correct DNS name

{% hint style="info" %}
This is your fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Please find some examples below explaining the DNS name.

* https://localhost/xmprosubscriptionmanager&#x20;
* https://desktop-f64k32e/xmprosubscriptionmanager
* https://demo.azurewebsites.com
{% endhint %}

| Complete Address                                 | DNS                     | Virtual Directory                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| https://localhost/xmprosubscriptionmanager       | <p></p><p>localhost</p> | <p></p><p>xmprosubscriptionmanager </p> |
| https://desktop-f64k32e/xmprosubscriptionmanager | desktop-f64k32e         | xmprosubscriptionmanager                |

**Virtual Directory**

14. Select the parent site from the Web Site drop-down

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, the Virtual Directory name will be "xmprosubscriptionmanager" which will be created within IIS for the Subscription Manager site. If you wish to change the name you can specify it in the "Virtual Directory Name" text box.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

15. Verify if the value in the content directory field is correct. If not, apply any changes needed

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, the option to create a sub-directory within the content directory is checked and you can specify a name in the “Sub-Directory” text box.
{% endhint %}

#### **Application Pool**

16. If you wish to change this name or use an existing application pool, click the Change button&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, a new application pool will be created when installing the site. The new application pool will have the same name as the name specified in the “Application Pool Name” field.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

17. Either select the “Create a new Application Pool” or “Use an existing Application Pool” option&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you choose “Create a new Application Pool”, give it an appropriate name. If you choose “Use an existing Application Pool”, select an existing application pool from the drop-down.
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

#### **Security Account**

18. Select a security account that can be used

{% hint style="info" %}
The default option is “LocalSystem”, which is a built-in security account. You can either change it by selecting a different built-in security account from the drop-down or by specifying your own security account.
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1258).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning**: If you selected Windows authentication to connect to the database, you must choose “Specify your own Security Account” and provide the correct credentials. The service account must have batch logon rights enabled. More Information on how to set up a custom application pool in IIS as well as steps on how to enable batch logon rights can be found [i](https://docs.xmpro.com/knowledge-base-2/setting-up-a-custom-application-pool-so-that-windows-authentication-can-be-used-when-installing-xmpro-enabling-batch-logon-rights-for-a-user/)n this [**link**](https://docs.xmpro.com/knowledge-base-2/setting-up-a-custom-application-pool-so-that-windows-authentication-can-be-used-when-installing-xmpro-enabling-batch-logon-rights-for-a-user/).
{% endhint %}

### SMTP

19. Enter the SMTP details referenced in the [**1. Preparation**](../install.md#smtp-account) guide. \
    By default, the "Enable Email Notification" is checked.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
SMTP can be disabled by unchecking the "Enable Email Notification" checkbox if you don't want to receive email notifications. If at a later stage email notifications are needed, the installer can be run again to add SMTP functionality.
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1381).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** You are required to set up an SMTP account. Failing to do so will make registering new users very cumbersome.



Check your connection to the email server using the "Test SMTP settings" button.
{% endhint %}

### Certificates

During the installation process, you will be asked to upload two certificates: a signing certificate and an encryption certificate. You may use the same certificate for both options. The instructions on how to create a certificate can be found in the [**1. Preparation**](../install.md) guide.

#### **Signing Certificate**

20. Start by browsing to a suitable _.pfx_ certificate file. Specify the password for the certificate&#x20;
21. Use the dropdown to select "Subject Name"

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended that you choose “LocalMachine” as the Location for the signing certificate.
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (356).png>)

#### **Encryption Certificate**

22. Start by browsing to a suitable _.pfx_ certificate file. Specify the password for the certificate
23. Use the dropdown to select "Subject Name"

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended that you choose “LocalMachine” as the Location for the encryption certificate.
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1431).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** Both certificates must contain a private key.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Final Steps

24. &#x20;Continue through the wizard, confirm the installation and the components will be installed

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1658).png>)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** Note the username and password on the last screen of the installer. This user has been created during installation as Subscription Manager itself needs at least one user in the system. Without it, you cannot add other users.



Change the password of the default user to a new, secure password after logging in for the first time.
{% endhint %}

### Accessing the Website

#### **Using Web Browser**

25. &#x20;Access the website by putting the URL into your browser

{% hint style="info" %}
The format of the URL will be as follows: “_https://yourdnsname/virtualdirectoryname/_”
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1728).png>)

### Obtaining an Installation Profile

To install the Data Stream Designer and App Designer, you will need an Installation Profile.

26. &#x20;Navigate to the XMPro Subscription Manager site as above
27. Go to the Subscription Manager page

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Home Image Current.jfif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

28. Click Products in the menu and click the Installation Profile button

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (179).png>)

29. &#x20;Enter a File Key and press OK to download the file

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** Remember the file key as it is needed when installing Data Stream Designer and App Designer.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1020).png>)

### Optional: IIS User Permissions

If you’ve chosen to use a **custom service account** during installation, you may have to perform an extra step. An error may be shown after logging into Subscription Manager, even after giving the _IIS\_USRS_ group permission on the signing certificate private keys. The error would be as follow: “_We could not grant you access to the requested subscription. There was an unexpected error_“. The logs would also contain the following error: “_System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException: Keyset does not exist_“.

To solve this issue, use this [**article**](https://docs.xmpro.com/knowledge-base-2/how-to-grant-permission-to-iis-user-on-xmpro-identity-service-signing-certificate/) as a guideline to grant access for the Application Pool Identity (in some cases a domain account) on the signing certificate private keys.

### SMTP

24. Enter the SMTP settings referenced in the [**1. Preparation**](../install.md#smtp-account) guide. \
    By default, the "Enable Email Notification" is checked.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
SMTP can be disabled by unchecking the "Enable Email Notification" checkbox if you don't want to receive email notifications. If at a later stage email notifications are needed, the installer can be run again to add SMTP functionality.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** You are required to set up an SMTP account. Failing to do so will make registering new users very cumbersome.



It is highly recommended to check your connection to the email server using the "Test SMTP settings" button.
{% endhint %}

### Twilio (Optional)

25. Enter the Twilio details referenced in the [**1. Preparation**](../install.md#twilio-optional) guide. If you don't want SMS notifications you can select "None" from the "Select Provider" dropdown.
