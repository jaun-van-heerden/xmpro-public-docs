This is useful either to compare packages or for source control and version management.</td></tr><tr><td>Enhancement</td><td>You can package the Agent's <a href="../../how-to-guides/agents/packaging-agents.md#category">Category</a> so that it is prepopulated when uploading to Data Stream Designer.

So another tab stayed selected, even after refreshing - or navigating away and returning to the App page.</p><p><em>The first tab would fail to cache, this has now been resolved.</em></p></td></tr><tr><td>Fix</td><td><p>Widening the <a href="../../blocks/visualizations/time-series-chart.md#hierarchy">Time Series Chart</a> hierarchy selection pop-up in v4.1.13 - to avoid truncating parameter names - caused the list to shift out of view if a resource icon is clicked.</p><p><em>Reverted the hierarchy prompt to its original size, but made the size adjustable.

A large number of XMPro tabs open at the same time is likely to cause performance-related issues.</td></tr><tr><td>Enhancement</td><td>The Time Series Chart's <a href="../../blocks/visualizations/time-series-chart.md#initial-selection">initial selection</a>'s unit of time is now a standalone property (<a href="../../blocks/visualizations/time-series-chart.md#initial-selection-unit-of-time">here</a>) for intuitive configuration.</td></tr><tr><td>Update</td><td>We've reduced our Linux-based Stream Host offering to support Ubuntu only, to increase our test coverage and ability to release often. <br>Linux RHEL and Debian Stream Hosts are no longer supported. </td></tr><tr><td>Fix</td><td>The detailed view of a <a href="../../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md#detailed-view">Recommendation Alert</a> - including its event data  - is visible to users with run access, whether it was accessed through manipulation of URL string parameters or not.
