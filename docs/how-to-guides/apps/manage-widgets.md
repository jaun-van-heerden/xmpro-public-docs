# Manage Widgets

Widgets are collections of Blocks or layouts that you can group together and re-use for other Apps and Pages. For example, if there is a common group of Blocks that is repetitive to continuously recreate, these Blocks can be selected and turned into a Widget. When a Widget is created, it is added as a Block in the Blocks toolbox and can then be dragged onto the canvas and re-used as many times as needed on any Page.&#x20;

It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Widgets.

## Creating a Widget

When a Widget is created, you can specify if the Widget can only be seen and used by you, or everyone else in the company. If everyone has access to it, anyone can drag and drop your Widget into their own apps. The owner of the Widget is the only one who can edit or delete it.

To create a Widget, follow the steps below:

1. Select the Blocks you would like to save as a Widget.
2. Click the save button to create a new Widget.
3. Enter the name.
4. The visibility determines who will be able to see and use your Widget. If set to _everyone_, anyone in your company or organization can drag and drop your Widget into their own Apps.
5. Choose an icon. Sample icons can be found in the [Icon Library](../../resources/icon-library.md).
6. Click _Create_.

When a Widget is created, it will show in the toolbox, under _'Blocks'_ in the _'Widget'_ category.

## Using Widgets

The Widget can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the canvas, and this will create the same set of blocks as before.

## Deleting a Widget

When a Widget is deleted, it will be removed from the sidebar and you will no longer be able to drag it onto the canvas. Deleting a Widget will not affect anything previously dropped onto the canvas on any Page.

1. Select Edit. Note that you will not be able to edit the Widget unless you are the owner of it.
2. Select Delete.
