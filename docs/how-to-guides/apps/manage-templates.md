# Manage Templates

Templates are pre-designed [Applications](../../concepts/application/) that can be selected when creating a new Application. Templates can be used to save time without having to build a whole new App layout from scratch, and also allow you to create a consistent theme or design that you can use across all your Applications.&#x20;

It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Templates.
