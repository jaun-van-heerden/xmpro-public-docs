# Manage Themes

The Application can either be Light-Themed or Dark-Themed. This depends on the overall design of the Application and can be configured when creating the App, and can also be edited after the app has been created. This is useful as some users or developers prefer to have a certain consistent light or dark-colored theme across their app, and this option allows you to customize the app to fit that preference.

It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Applications.

## Default Theme when creating a new App

The Default Theme is the theme that will be automatically selected when you create a new Page within the Application. For example, if the Default Theme for the overall Application is dark, when you create a new Page, the Default Theme for that Page will always be set to dark.&#x20;

To choose the Default Theme when creating a new Application, follow the steps below:

1. Click on the _plus_ button from the left-hand menu to add a new application.
2. Select the Default Theme when creating an App.
