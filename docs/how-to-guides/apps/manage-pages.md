# Manage Pages

A Page is a web page built with XMPro's App Designer. Pages allow you to separate the Application into sections, navigate between the Pages, and pass data between Pages using Parameters.&#x20;

It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Pages.

## Designing a Page

Once a Page has been created, you can design your Page to meet your specifications. There are many Blocks or controls that can be added from the Blocks tab such as Text, Number, and Date Boxes, Grids, Charts, Gauges, Accordions, and Tabs. [The full list of Blocks can be found here](../../concepts/application/block.md#list-of-blocks).&#x20;

### Adding New Blocks

Blocks are accessed through the Blocks tab in the page designer and can be added to the page by dragging them into the Canvas. Blocks can also be searched by typing in the search bar at the top.&#x20;

### Moving Blocks in the Canvas

Blocks can be rearranged within the Canvas in a few ways:

#### Moving Blocks using the Canvas

1. Click and drag the Block you want to move.
2. Hover over where you want to move the Block to. A green line and an orange outline will appear to show where the Block will end up.
3. Release the mouse to drop the Block.

#### Moving Blocks using the Toolbar

Sometimes the Block you want to move may be hard to click or behind other Blocks. In this case, you can move the Block by its drag handle button in the blue toolbar.

1. Select the Block by clicking one of its children and clicking the Select Parent button in the blue toolbar or by selecting it in the Page Layers.
2. Click and drag the drag handle button in the blue toolbar.
3. Hover over where you want to move the Block to. A green line and an orange outline will appear to show where the Block will end up.
4. Release the mouse to drop the Block.

#### Moving Blocks by the Page Layers

Sometimes you may need to be more precise in dragging a Block. In this case, you can move the Block by rearranging it in the Page Layers. [See the Page Layers article for more information on how to use Page Layers.](use-page-layers.md)

1. Expand the Block you want to move and the Block you want to put in the Page Layers.
2. Click and drag the drag handle in the Page Layers.
3. Hover over where you want to move the block to. A green line and an orange outline will appear to show where the block will end up.
4. Release the mouse to drop the block.
