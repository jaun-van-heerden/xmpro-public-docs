# Use Page Layers

Blocks are organized on the Canvas in a hierarchy. A list view of this hierarchy is visible by selecting the Page Layers tab in the toolbox. This can make selecting Blocks simpler and easier as some Applications may have many nested layers and it can be difficult to select them on the Canvas itself. Each Block that is selected also displays a list of any children Blocks if applicable. This allows you to find the exact Block you need to manipulate.

3. Click and drag the handle on the right.&#x20;

## Renaming blocks

Renaming Blocks will not affect what the block looks like at runtime, it will only change the text or label that will appear when you hover over the Block. To rename Blocks, follow the steps below:

1. Click on _Page Layers_.
2. Expand layers to get to the element.
3. Double Click on the text to highlight it and change it.

Changing the name will not change the content of the Block, it will only change what the Block is called.
