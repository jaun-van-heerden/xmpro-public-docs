# Use Expression Properties

Expression Properties allow you to create short scripts to create a custom value. This custom value can be calculated from other Variables, Parameters, user input, data from Data Sources, and various Functions, Constants, and Operators. [See the Variable and Expressions article to learn more about Expressions](../../concepts/application/variables-and-expressions.md).
