# Manage Apps

An Application or App enables you to create Apps using a drag-and-drop canvas environment. This allows anyone including Engineers and subject matter experts to build an App in a matter of days or weeks without having to be a programmer.

Clicking on the Applications button in the menu will take you to the Applications list. The Applications list is grouped by Category. Apps that have the play icon are Published.&#x20;

Click on a row to view an App, or click on an edit button to edit an App. The edit button will only be shown for Apps that you have edit access to.

Clicking on a Category on the App Designer Categories dashboard will take you to the Applications dashboard for that Category. Each card shows the Icon, Name, and Description of the App as well as how many users have access, the version, the time and date it was last modified, the owner's profile picture and name, and whether the App is Published - if so it will have "Active" in green, and if not it will have "Draft" in yellow.
