# Create and Maintain Notes

Notes are a way to share information about an Application between creators of the App and for future reference. They are useful when you want to communicate and record technical or non-technical information about the Application. The Notes are for the Application, so no matter how many Pages the Application has, the Notes will always remain the same. Notes are also saved across versions.
