# Manage Access

XMPro Objects such as Data Streams, Recommendations, Applications, and more can be shared with different users. The person that originally created the XMPro Object will be listed as the owner. When sharing the XMPro Object with other users, users can either be given Co-owner, read, or write access.&#x20;
