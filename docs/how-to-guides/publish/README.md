# Publish

Publishing will finalize the XMPro asset and make it available for all users with Run Access. To configure the run access and who can see the asset once it is published, visit [How to Manage Access](../manage-access.md). Versions of XMPro Objects that are already published cannot be edited or deleted by any user, and must be unpublished before they can be edited. Only one version of an XMPro Object can be published at a time.

## How to Publish

To publish an XMPro asset, follow the steps below:

1. Open the page for the XMPro asset you would like to publish and select the data stream/recommendation/application.
2. Click on _Publish._

{% hint style="info" %}
The Publish button will only be available if the version you are currently viewing is not published. If another version is published clicking the button will change the published version to the current version.
{% endhint %}

## How to Unpublish

Unpublishing is done in the same location where you publish the asset. Navigate to the same place that you published the asset.

1. Open the page for the XMPro asset you would like to unpublish and select the data stream/recommendation/application.
2. Click on _Unpublish._

{% hint style="info" %}
You can unpublish an XMPro Object even if you are currently viewing another version. The Unpublish button will only be available if any version of that XMPro Object is currently published. Clicking the button will unpublish the version that is published.
{% endhint %}
