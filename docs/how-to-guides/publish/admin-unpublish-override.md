# Admin Unpublish Override

Apps and Data Streams can be published and unpublished in other parts of App Designer and Data Stream Designer

In App Designer, you can publish or unpublish an App via the Connectors page. In Data Stream Designer, you can publish or unpublish a Data Stream via the Agents or Collections page.

Admins are able to see all Apps or Data Streams, whereas users can only see the Apps or Data Streams to which they have access. This can be useful for Admins if they need to unpublish an App or Data Stream if they do not have access to it.
