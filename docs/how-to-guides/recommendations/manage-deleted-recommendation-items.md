# Manage Deleted Recommendation Items

When a [Recommendation](../../concepts/recommendation/) is deleted, it is moved to the Deleted Items. This is because there may still be archived [Recommendation Alerts](../../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md) created by that Recommendation that you don't want to delete. Once Recommendations are moved to Deleted Items, they can be restored. This ensures nothing is deleted by mistake and allows you to retrieve deleted Recommendations again in the future if you realize they are still needed.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of deleting Recommendations.
