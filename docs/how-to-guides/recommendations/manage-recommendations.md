# Manage Recommendations

If a Run Recommendation Agent is added to a [Data Stream](../../concepts/data-stream/), the Recommendation will read the live data in real-time and compare it to the conditions and [Rules](../../concepts/recommendation/rule.md) configured. If any data falls into a Rule's condition then a [Recommendation Alert](../../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md) is created. A Recommendation Alert notifies specific users of pending issues or dangers associated with the data and allows them to act upon them.
