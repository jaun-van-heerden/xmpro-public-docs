# Manage Rules

A Rule is a condition that helps the [Recommendation](../../concepts/recommendation/) determine whether [Recommendation Alerts](../../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md) should be created, and what created Alerts should look like. This is needed for you to create the condition(s) that the Recommendation needs to look for. An example of a Rule is "If the temperature is greater than 50". This catches any data that does not stay within the safe parameters.
