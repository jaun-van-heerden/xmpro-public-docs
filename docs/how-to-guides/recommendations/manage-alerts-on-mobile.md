# Manage Alerts on Mobile

Recommendation Alerts are advanced Alerts that get triggered when real-time data meets the criteria defined in a [Recommendation Rule](../../concepts/recommendation/rule.md). They notify you when certain conditions occur in your data and provide decision support for how to take action.

[Recommendations](../../concepts/recommendation/) create new Recommendation Alerts based on [Business Rules](../../concepts/recommendation/rule.md#rule-logic), and the Alerts recommend the best next actions based on expert suggestions. Recommendation Alerts monitor the actions taken and outcomes to close the loop on event response.&#x20;
