# Manage Variables

Variables are placeholders used to hold and maintain certain values. In some cases, it is possible to not know some of the values that you might want to compare within rules or conditions. In this case, you can use Variables where the real value can be substituted in later. Expressions can also be configured and are useful for doing certain calculations and returning results which can also be used within Recommendation [Rules](../../concepts/recommendation/rule.md). &#x20;
