# Manage Notifications

A Notification defines how users will be notified when a [Recommendation Alert](../../concepts/recommendation/recommendation-alert.md) is triggered by a critical event that meets the conditions set in a [Rule](../../concepts/recommendation/rule.md). This is useful when you want to send a text, email, or another form of communication to users when something goes wrong and is caught by the Rule's condition.
