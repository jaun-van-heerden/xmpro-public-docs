# Use Live View

When a Data Stream is published, the Live View option becomes visible to allow you to view the data that is being processed by the Agents in the Stream. The way the data is displayed can be changed from a grid view to a gauge or a chart. This is useful for viewing the flow of data in real time and is also, therefore, a good tool to use when debugging. &#x20;

It is recommended that you read the article listed below to improve your understanding of Live Data.

## Viewing Live Data

To view this data, publish your Stream first, then select the “Live View” button. Follow the steps below:

1. Select Live View after publishing your Stream.
2. Select the Agents you would like to view data for.

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure your Data Stream is published before trying to open the _Live View_.

Prior to v4.3.7, it was important to always close the _Live View_ before navigating away. Otherwise, connections were left open. If these build up over time and affect performance, an admin can reset them [here](../manage-site-settings.md#live-view-usage).
