#### Masks

A masked text box allows the user to enter a value in a specific pattern. The _mask_ determines the input that needs to be entered, for example, a phone number pattern like _+1 (X00) 000-0000_. The _mask character_ is the character that will show to mask the part that needs to be entered. The _Mask Invalid Message_ is the message that is displayed when the entered text does not match the specified pattern.
