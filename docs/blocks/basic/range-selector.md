# Range Slider

A Range Slider is an input field that can be used to select a numeric value within a given range. This is useful when there is a limited number of options the user should select from and eases the validation for the user's input.

## Range Slider Properties

### Appearance

#### Common Properties

The Range Slider has the option to change its _visibility_ and to show _tooltips_.&#x20;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties.](../common-properties.md#appearance)

Options that are specific to Range Sliders include the ability to change the _mode, range,_ or _labels_. The appearance of the labels such as the positioning and format of the labels can also be configured.

#### Mode

In point mode, only the single point that the user selected will be visible. When in range mode, the Range Slider allows you to specify whether or not to show the range line between the two selected values.

#### Show Labels

Show labels will add a value on both sides of the slider so the user will know the numeric range.

#### Step

This affects the intervals that are allowed between the values that can be chosen. For example, if the step interval is set to 50, and the user selects 45, the slider value will automatically be set to 50.

### Value

If the _point_ option is selected as the _mode_, there will only be one value. However, if the _range_ option is selected as the mode, you can choose a _start value_ or an _end value_.

#### Point Value

This determines what the selected value is when the mode is set to the _point_ option.

#### Range Start and End value

This determines the range that is selected from the start value to the end value. This is available when the _range_ option is selected for the mode.
