## Data Selector Properties

### Appearance

#### Common Properties

You can change the _visibility, styling mode_, _placeholder_, and _tooltip_.&#x20;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties.](../common-properties.md#appearance)

#### Adaptive Behavior

For some screen sizes, the date picker may not fit across the screen. If enabled, this allows the box to be displayed in a different format, for example, the date box is displayed without the large analog clock and uses a digital clock instead. This is useful for smaller devices such as mobile or IPads.
