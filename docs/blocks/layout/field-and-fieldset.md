# Field & Fieldset

A Field is a Block where the user can enter details and is useful for collecting information on a Form. Fieldsets are Blocks that already contain Fields and can be used to group Fields within a larger Form. Fields or groups of Fields can be validated to ensure the user has entered the correct input.
