# Toolbar

The Toolbar is a UI component that can contain items that are used to manage screen content. Those items can be plain text or other blocks such as images and are useful for showing options to the user in a more visual form than a regular menu.

### Adding Toolbar Items

The Toolbar Block has 3 areas, _before_, _center,_ and _after_. Adding new items can be done in two ways. The first one is to add it by clicking the _plus_ sign when you have either the toolbar or tollbar item selected. This is will create a new item with default settings.

If you have the toolbar selected and add a new item it will be added to the _before_ section which is the first one from the left. If you have the toolbar item selected and click the _plus_ sign, the new item will be added to the same section as the selected item.\

Items can be moved by dragging and dropping them to the desired section.
