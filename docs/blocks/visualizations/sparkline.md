# Sparkline

A Sparkline is a Block that allows you to display data. A Sparkline can only display one series or data set in the graph and are therefore small graphs that do not take up much space. They can be embedded into text or easily added to the cells of a table. This is useful for displaying very specific data that focus on a single variable.
