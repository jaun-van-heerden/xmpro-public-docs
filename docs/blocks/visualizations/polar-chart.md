# Polar Chart

This Block allows you to display data in the format of a Polar Chart. This is a useful way to visualize multivariate data and to plot one or more groups of values over common variables. For example, each series can represent a particular observation or group of data points, and these can be compared to other data sets in the same graph.&#x20;

## Polar Chart Properties

### Appearance

#### Common Properties

Options for the appearance include its _visibility_.&#x20;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties.](../common-properties.md#appearance)

Polar Charts also include the _spider web, start angle, tick interval, argument line color, display grid lines, grid-line color, display labels,_ and _tick position_ options. The _series_ and _alignment_ of the chart can also be configured.

#### Spider Web

This determines the shape of the Polar Chart.

#### Start Angle

This specifies the starting point of the line in the middle of the Polar Chart.

#### Tick Interval

This determines how many grid lines appear between each value if the outer argument is a number. A tick interval of 0 is the default value.

#### Argument Line Color

This changes the line color of the argument or outer field.

#### Display Labels

This determines if the labels are visible or not.

#### Hide Series on Legend Click

This allows you to toggle the visibility of each of the series when it is clicked on in the legend.

This specifies the alignment of the legend. Options include top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, or bottom-right.&#x20;

### Data Source

#### Common Properties

Properties that are common to most Blocks include: _filter, sort, show # of results,_ and _skip # of results;_

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common Data Source properties.](../common-properties.md#data-source)

The Data Source property is required for the Polar Chart.

### Data

#### Series

This determines what fields or data displays on the Polar Chart. The fields can be selected from a connected Data Source.
