# Linear Gauge

This Block allows you to display data in the format of a Linear Gauge. The Linear Gauge is a scale that indicates a single value or multiple values. Linear Gauges are useful for displaying and visualizing numeric values within a certain range.

## Linear Gauge Properties

### Appearance

#### Common Properties

The _visibility_ property is common to most Blocks;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common appearance properties.](../common-properties.md#appearance)

Options that are specific to Linear Gauges include the ability to change the _orientation, title, font color, tick interval_, and the style of the primary and sub-values.

#### Orientation

This determines if the Linear Gauge is displayed horizontally or vertically.

#### Tick Interval

This determines the number interval of the Linear Gauge.

#### Primary Value Indicator Type

This determines the shape of the marker that points to the value on the gauge. Options include a rectangle, circle, rhombus, range bar, triangle marker, and text cloud.

#### Primary Value Format Text as Percentage

This is only available if the indicator type is a text cloud. Enabling this will show the text on the screen as a percentage.

#### Primary Value Indicator Color

This determines the color of the indicator.

#### Primary Value Indicator Offset

This determines how far away the needle or marker is when pointing to the value.

#### Sub Value Indicator Type

This determines the style of the sub-values showing on the Linear Gauge. The indicator type refers to the shape of the needle that points to the value on the gauge.

#### Sub Value Format Text as Percentage

This is only available if the indicator type for the sub-value is a text cloud. Enabling this will show the text on the screen as a percentage.

#### Sub Value Indicator Color

This determines the color of the sub-values.

#### Sub Value Indicator Offset

This determines how far away the need or marker is when pointing to the sub-value.

### Behavior

#### Common Properties

The _disabled_ property is common to most Blocks;

[See the Common Properties article for more details on common behavior properties.](../common-properties.md#behavior)

#### Start Range and End Range

The start and end range define the boundaries of where the values of the Linear Gauge should start and end.
