## Embedded AI

Leverage Machine Learning (ML) to extract actionable insights from vast data volumes, uncover hidden patterns, predict outcomes, and drive business growth and efficiency.&#x20;

### Advanced Analytics and Predictive Insights

Visit our [Blueprints, Accelerators, and Patterns repository](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/) to see how you can embed AI:&#x20;

* Remaining Use of Life (RUL) Data Stream, which uses our [Python ](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/python/)Agent, in the[ Smart Manufacturing Accelerator](https://github.com/XMPro/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/tree/master/Accelerators/Smart%20Manufacturing%20-%20Bottling%20Plant).
* The [Asset Monitoring - Binary Classification Pattern](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/patterns/Asset-Monitoring-Binary-Classification/) utilizes our [Binary Classification ](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/binary-classification/)Agent.
* The [Liner Wear Prediction - Regression Pattern](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/patterns/Liner-Wear-Prediction-Regression/) utilizes our [Regression](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/regression/) Agent.
* The [Vertical Travel - Forecasting Pattern](https://xmpro.github.io/Blueprints-Accelerators-Patterns/patterns/Vertical-Travel-Forecasting/) utilizes our [Forecasting](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/forecasting/) Agent.

## Innovation AI

Utilize XMPro Intelligent Digital Twins and [XMPro Notebooks](xmpro-notebook.md) for scalable and cost-effective innovation with AI.&#x20;

### Simulation and Optimization

Conduct simulations, real-time visualizations, explore different configurations, predict outcomes, and identify parameters for improving efficiency, productivity, or energy consumption.&#x20;

## Augmented AI

Interact with systems, applications, and proprietary data using natural language commands, fostering effortless communication, enhanced user experiences, and increased adoption of intelligent automation solutions.&#x20;

### Co-Pilot Capability in App Designer

Build a widget to harness OpenAI from within your Application. Ask for advice from your co-pilot and paste the results into the related recommendation alert.

## Model Governance Support

As AI scales within the organization, corporate guardrails require AI to be modeled within an MLOps framework.

Our [MLflow Agent](https://xmpro.gitbook.io/mlflow/) is the first in a series, that enables effective model governance using a popular MLOps toolset. This empowers data scientists to promote new model versions within [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) without going back to edit the XMPro Data Stream.&#x20;

In the example below, version 1 of a model is configured and the Data Stream is published. Observe that the first event printed confirms model version one was used to make a prediction.&#x20;

We then switch to MLflow to promote version 2 to production. Observe that when we switch back to the Data Stream output, model version two is seamlessly used to make the next prediction.
