# App Files

App Files are a way to import files into an Application. App Files are managed through the App Files command or through the + button next to related properties in the Block Properties of a Page. Some Blocks allow the selection of App Files for some Block Properties.

The App Files explorer allows you to use, rename, delete, and perform more actions on an uploaded file. App Files are useful in many scenarios, for example, if you need specific files to integrate Unity or D3 Visualizations onto the page.

## List of Blocks that use App Files

* [Unity](../../blocks/visualizations/unity-1.md)
* [D3 Visualization](../../blocks/visualizations/d3-visualization.md)

#### Unity

Files that can be uploaded for Unity include the Unity web assembly code file, Unity data file, and Unity framework file for a Unity project. [See the Unity article to view the files you will need to integrate a Unity project.](../../blocks/visualizations/unity-1.md)

#### D3 Visualization

Files that can be uploaded for D3 Visualizations include an HTML script that is used to create data visualization which will allow you to display data from a data source in real-time. [See the D3 Visualizations article for more information about how to write and upload a script.](../../blocks/visualizations/d3-visualization.md)
